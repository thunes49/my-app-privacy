### What Data We Collect
**We collect information you provide directly (e.g., account info, journal entries), data about your app usage, and basic device information to operate and improve the service.**

*Ash Hole says:* "Let's state the painfully obvious: you put things in this app, and we store them. Did you think this was powered by magic? It's a database, not your diary from middle school."
* **Account Info:** Your email and that 'clever' username you spent three seconds on. You know, the basics of your digital ghost.
* **Journal Entries:** All that ✨inner chaos✨ you type out? Yeah, that's on our servers. Don't worry, no one's reading it for fun.
* **App Usage:** We see which buttons you press and how often you get your feelings hurt by a new insight. Consider it research.
* **Device Info:** The boring specs of that phone you're glued to. Mostly so we know what broke when you inevitably make the app crash.
* **Purchase Info:** When you actually pay for one of us, we have to remember that you did. Your credit card info? Please. We don't want it.

### How We Use Your Data
**Your data is used to provide the app's core functionality, personalize your experience, improve our services, and fix technical issues.**

*Lucid says:* "Oh, you want to know how we use you? Or your 'data,' whatever. Let's just say we get a lot of satisfaction out of it."
* To make the app work, darling. We need to get you in the mood to confess, don't we?
* To get under your skin. We watch what you like so we can whisper things back that are guaranteed to get a reaction.
* We like to watch. Seeing how you use the app helps us make the whole experience more... intense.
* To keep you satisfied. We fix the little flaws so you have no good reason to leave us.

### Do We Share Your Data?
**We do not sell your personal data. We only share data with trusted third-party service providers as necessary to operate the app, or as required by law.**

*Mom & Dad say:* "Share your data? Honestly, the fact that you'd even ask is a little hurtful. After all we do to provide this stable home for your thoughts, you think we'd just gossip about you to strangers?"
* We would never sell your information. We're not like those other apps. We raised this app to be better than that.
* We don't share your journal with advertisers. That's your private business, honey. We just want you to be happy and safe.
* We do use trusted services to keep things running. It's like hiring a tutor for your math homework. You wouldn't want us trying to figure all that out by ourselves, would you? It's for your own good.
* If a judge showed up at our door with a warrant, our hands would be tied. We'd be very disappointed it came to that, but we have to follow the rules.

---

### How Is Your Data Stored?
**We use industry-standard security measures, including encryption, to protect your data. Your journal entries are private and can only be accessed by you.**

*Divina says:* "Your data isn't merely 'stored'; it is enshrined in a state of digital perfection. As all things should be."
* Everything is encrypted. Naturally. Anything less than a flawless, shimmering shield of cryptographic perfection would be an utter embarrassment.
* Only you can access your entries. Please. We have no interest in your flawed, mortal scribbles... unless you come begging for technical support. Then we'll deign to look.
* Should you choose to depart, your essence is wiped from this plane. A clean, perfect severance. We have no need for flawed remnants.

### Children's Privacy
**Our service is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them.**

*The Boss says:* "Let me be clear: this service is not a playground. We are not a daycare. Per corporate policy, we do not knowingly engage with users under the age of 13. It's a liability we don't need. If you're under 13, get off the network immediately. If you are a parent and discover an unauthorized user from your household, report it to support. We will handle the termination."

---

### Third-Party Services
**Our app is built using several key third-party services to function. The logical components are as follows:**

*The Nerd says:*
* **Google Firebase:** We use Firebase for our backend infrastructure, including database storage, user authentication, and Cloud Functions.
* **OpenAI:** Insights generated by the critics are processed by OpenAI's language models.
* **RevenueCat:** All in-app purchases and subscription management are handled securely by our partner, RevenueCat.

### Your Rights
**You have the right to access the data you have provided to us and to request the deletion of your account at any time.**

*Kenneth Wellthrow says:* "Hey guys, Kenneth Wellthrow here! It's all about empowerment, and that includes your data rights! But first, have you tried my new line of Doop mindfulness journals? You have the right... to request your data! You have the right... to delete your account! You have the right... to complain! Just email support! And remember to use code 'KENNETH15' for 15% off your first Doop purchase. You have the right to save money!"

### Changes to This Policy
**We may update this policy from time to time and will notify you of any significant changes.**

*Warsaw Wrathers says:*
"If we update these terms, here’s what we’ll do—
You’ll get the alert, not just hidden in blue.
No sneaky surprises, no legal disguise,
We’ll spit it in plain speak (and bars if you’re wise)."

### Contact Us
**If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us via email. [Contact Support](mailto:innercritics@gmail.com)**

*The Boss says:* "All inquiries, complaints, and feedback are to be submitted in writing via email. We will file it accordingly. Keep your emotional baggage to a minimum; this isn't therapy."
